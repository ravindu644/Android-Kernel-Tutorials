<h2> ‚úÖ Downloading the kernel source code for your device</h2>

- **‚ö†Ô∏è If your device is Samsung,**

#### 01. Download the kernel source from here: [Samsung Opensource]( https://opensource.samsung.com/main)

<img src="./screenshots/1.png">

#### 02. Extract the ```Kernel.tar.gz``` from the source zip, unarchive it using this command and please do not use any apps to do this:

```bash
tar -xvf Kernel.tar.gz && rm Kernel.tar.gz
```

<img src="./screenshots/2.png">

**Note:** It's a good idea to give the entire kernel directory 755 permission to remove those read-only error from files and folders. This prevents issues when editing files and upstreaming the kernel.

**Run this command to fix it:**

```
chmod +755 -R /path/to/extracted/kernel/
```

## ‚úÖ Understanding `non-GKI` & `GKI kernels`

### 01. GKI project introduction

Generic Kernel Image, or GKI, is an Android's project that aims for reducing kernel fragmentation, (and also improving Android

stability), by unifying kernel core and moving SoC and Board support out of the core kernel into loadable vendor modules.

### 02. pre-GKI/non-GKI and GKI linux version table
```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|          Android LTS Kernel Versions             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|       pre-GKI       |     GKI 1.0    |  GKI 2.0  |
+---------------------+----------------+-----------+
|         3.10        |       5.4      |   5.10    |
|         3.18        |                |   5.15    |
|         4.4         |                |   6.1     |
|         4.9         |                |   6.6     |
|         4.14        |                |           |
|         4.19        |                |           |
+---------------------+----------------+-----------+
```
#### Explanation:

1. **pre-GKI or non-GKI**:
   - The oldest Android kernel branch, likely starts from Linux version 2.x.
   - These kernels are **device-specific** because its often heavily modified to accommodate SoCs and OEMs needs.
   - Starting to get deprecated in ACK, since `linux-4.19.y` branch already reaching EoL (End of Life) state, with last Linux 4.19.325

3. **GKI 1.0**:
   - Android's first generation of the Generic Kernel Image, starts and also ends from kernel version **5.4**.
   - The first generation of GKI is not yet matured as second generation of GKI.
   - These kernels are considered as **device-specific**, but more commonized, depends on how OEMs and SoCs Manufacturer treat them.
   - A few variants exist for certain SoC, like qGKI (Qualcomm GKI), and mGKI (Mediatek GKI) because has been modified to accommodate SoCs manufacturer needs.

4. **GKI 2.0**:
   - Android's second generation of the Generic Kernel Image, starting with kernel version **5.10**.
   - In this second generation, GKI project starting to get matured properly.
   - This kernel is considered as "universal", since you can boot a GKI kernels that builded with Google's GKI kernel source on **some** devices, if correct and match.

---

### Notes:
- **LTS = Long-Term Support**: These kernels are stable, well-maintained, and receive long-term updates.
- **GKI = Generic Kernel Image**: A unified kernel framework introduced by Google to standardize the kernel across Android devices.
- **SoC = System on Chip**
- **ACK = Android Common Kernel**: An Android's linux LTS kernel branch, modified to accommodate Android needs.
- OEMs like Samsung may still modify GKI 2.0 kernels to accommodate their needs, and can cause some issues like broken Sdcard and broken Audio stuff. So use
  their GKI kernel source instead if possible.

## ‚úÖ Understanding the ```Kernel root```

<img src="./screenshots/6.png">

- As you can see in the above screenshot, it's the Linux kernel source code.
- It must have those folders, **highlighted in blue in the terminal.**
- **In GKI kernels,** the kernel root is located in a folder named "common".

- If you have a **GKI Samsung kernel**, you should use the "common" kernel instead of "msm-kernel" for the compilation.

<h2> ‚úÖ Preparing for the Compilation</h2>

### 01. After downloading or cloning the Kernel Source, we should have a build script to compile our kernel.

- Before creating a build script, we must determine the compatible compilers we will use to build our kernel.

- Run ```make kernelversion``` inside the kernel root to check your kernel version.

<img src="./screenshots/5.png">

- In my case, the kernel version is **5.4,** with qualcomm chipset, which is [qGKI](https://github.com/ravindu644/Android-Kernel-Tutorials#-understanding-non-gki--gki-kernels).

- You can find full information about **choosing the correct compiler for your kernel version** [here](./toolchains/) (based on my experience, btw).

- Keep in mind that **you don't need to manually download any of these toolchains** since my build scripts handle everything for you :)  

- Next, go to [build_scripts](./build_scripts/), choose the appropriate script, download it, and place it inside your kernel's root directory.

<img src="./screenshots/7.png">

<hr>

### 02. Edit the Build script:

**üí° Better to Know:** A **defconfig** (default configuration) is like a preset settings file for the kernel.

- It tells the build system which features to enable or disable.

**So, Open the build script in a text editor and make these changes:**

- Replace `your_defconfig` to your current defconfig which is located in `arch/arm64/configs`

- In GKI 2.0 kernels, it's normally `gki_defconfig`

- But just in case, make sure to check `arch/arm64/configs` or `arch/arm64/configs/vendor`

- If your defconfig is located in the `arch/arm64/configs` directory, just replace `your_defconfig` with the name of your defconfig.

- If your defconfig is located in the `arch/arm64/configs/vendor` directory, replace `your_defconfig` like this:
  
  - `vendor/name_of_the_defconfig`
  - Example patch: [here](./patches/005.edit-defconfig.patch)

  <img src="./screenshots/12.png">

**‚ùóIf your device is Samsung Exynos, it doesn't support compiling the kernel in a separated 'out' directory. So, [edit your build script like this](./patches/001.nuke_out.patch)**  

---
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è [IMPORTANT] : *If your device is Samsung, it usually uses some device-specific variables in "some" kernels.*

- **As an example,** in the Galaxy S23 FE kernel source code, we can see they used variables called `TARGET_SOC=s5e9925`, `PLATFORM_VERSION=12`, and `ANDROID_MAJOR_VERSION=s`

- **If we didn't export those variables correctly,** the kernel failed to build in my case.

- Don't worry, they usually mention these required variables in their `README_Kernel.txt` or their own `build_kernel.sh`

  <img src="./screenshots/16.png">

**Refer to this example patch to properly integrate such variables into our build script:** [here](./patches/007.Define-OEM-Variables.patch)

**Note:** Just don't overthink it, even if they use values like 12 and S for Platform and Android versions, even if you have a higher Android version.

---

### 03. Edit the Makefile.

- If you find these variables: ```REAL_CC``` or ```CFP_CC``` in your "Makefile", remove them from the "Makefile", then Search for "wrapper" in your Makefile. If there's a line related to a Python file, remove that entire line/function as well.

    - Example patch of removing the wrapper: [click here](./patches/004.remove_gcc%20wrapper.patch)

<hr>

### 04. Now, grant executable permissions to ```build_xxxx.sh``` using this command.
  ```
  chmod +x build_xxxx.sh
  ```
### 05. Finally, run the build script using this command :
  ```
./build_xxxx.sh
```
> [!NOTE]
> GKI 2.0 kernel with branch `android14-5.15`, `android14-6.1`, and `android15-6.6` may require [bazel](https://bazel.build) to build!
>
> Common command/known command:
>
> `chmod +x tools/bazel && tools/bazel build --config=fast //common:kernel_aarch64_dist`
> 
> Please read Google's build instructions or OEM's instructions if exist.

<img src="./screenshots/8.png">

- When you run the script for the first time, it will begin to install all the necessary dependencies and start downloading the required toolchains, depending on your kernel version.

- Make sure not to interrupt the first run. If it gets interrupted somehow, delete the `toolchains` folder from "~/" and try again: ```rm -rf ~/toolchains```

<img src="./screenshots/9.png">

### After the initial run is completed, the kernel should start building, 

<img src="./screenshots/11.png">

### and the "menuconfig" should appear.

<img src="./screenshots/10.png">

- **Additional notes:**
    - You can completely ignore anything displayed as `warning:`
      - Eg: `warning: ignoring unsupported character '`
<hr>

## ‚úÖ Customizing the Kernel (Temporary Method)
- Once the *menuconfig* appears, you can navigate through it and customize the Kernel in a graphical way as needed.

- **As an example,** we can customize **the Kernel name, enable new drivers, enable new file systems, disable security features,** and more :)

#### You can navigate the *menuconfig* using the arrow keys (‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üì) on your keyboard and press `y` to enable, `n` to disable or `m` to enable as a module `<M>`.

### 1. Changing the Kernel name.

- I guess no explanation is needed for this:

    <img src="./screenshots/14.png" width="60%">

- Located in: `General setup  ---> Local version - append to kernel release`

<img src="./gif/1.gif">

### 2. Enabling BTRFS support.

- Btrfs is a modern Linux filesystem with copy-on-write, snapshots, and built-in RAID, ideal for reliability and scalability.

- Located in: `File systems  ---> < > Btrfs filesystem support`

<img src="./gif/2.gif">

### 3. Enabling more CPU Governors

- **CPU governors control how the processor adjusts it's speed.**
-  You can choose between performance-focused governors (like "performance" for max speed) or battery-saving ones (like "powersave").
-  Please note that this may impact your SoC‚Äôs lifespan if the device overheats while handling performance-intensive tasks.

**Enabling more CPU Governors:**

- Located in: `CPU Power Management  ---> CPU Frequency scaling  ---> `

<img src="./gif/3.gif">

**Changing the Default CPU Governor:**

- Located in: `CPU Power Management  ---> CPU Frequency scaling  ---> Default CPUFreq governor (performance)  --->`

<img src="./gif/4.gif">

### 4. Enabling more IO Schedulers

- **IO schedulers control how your system handles reading and writing data to storage.**
- Different schedulers can make your system faster or help it run smoother, depending on what you're doing (like gaming, browsing, or saving battery).
- Located in: `IO Schedulers  --->`

<img src="./screenshots/15.png">

### The problem with menuconfig is that you have to do this every time you run the build script.

- All the changes you've made using menuconfig are saved in a temporary hidden file called `.config` inside the `out` directory.

  <img src="./screenshots/18.png">

- and it resets every time you run the build script.

  <img src="./screenshots/17.png">

- So, we need a permanent method to save our changes, right?  

## ‚úÖ Customizing the Kernel (Permanent Method)

- In this method, **we are going to create a separate `custom.config` to store our changes** and **link it to our build script.** 

- After that, when we run the build script, **it will first use your OEM defconfig to generate the `.config` file, then merge the changes from our `custom.config` into `.config` again.** 

**Refer to these examples to get a basic idea:** [patch](./patches/008.add-custom-defconfig-support.patch), [commit](https://github.com/ravindu644/android_kernel_m145f_common/commit/c427dbebed22c5bb314b4c94c711deffe671b14c)

---

### ü§ì How to add changes to our `custom.config` ?

- First, We have to find the exact **kernel configuration option** you want to **enable** or **disable**.

- Example **kernel configuration option**: `CONFIG_XXXX=y`

  - `CONFIG_XXXX`: The name of the kernel option or feature **( Must begin with `CONFIG_` )**
  - `=y`: This means "yes" -> the option is enabled and will be included in the kernel.
  - `=n`: This means "no" -> the option is disabled.

- You can find the name of the **kernel configuration option** this way:

  - Run the build script and wait until `menuconfig` appears.
  - Navigate to the option/feature you want to enable.
  - Press `shift + ?` on your keyboard, and an explanation about the option/feature will appear.
  - You‚Äôll see the name of the **kernel configuration option** in the top-left corner of the menuconfig.

    <img src="./screenshots/19.png">

  - **Copy that name** and add it to your `custom.config` with `=y` or `=n` to enable or disable it.

    <img src="./screenshots/20.png">
    
## ‚úÖ Compiling the Kernel

- Once you've customized the kernel as you want, simply **exit menuconfig**.  
- After exiting, the kernel will start compiling!

<img src="./gif/5.gif">

### üí° If everything goes smoothly like this,

  <img src="./screenshots/21.png">

### you‚Äôll find the built kernel `Image` inside the `build` folder in your kernel root!

  <img src="./screenshots/22.png">

## üü• Fixing the Known compiling issues

- **If you ever encounter any errors during your kernel compilation,** jump to [fixes](./fixes/) and see if your specific issue is mentioned there.
